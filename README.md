## **Introduction** # 
Hey there!
I am Kartik Gupta & this is my Repository with 
* 9 python Basic codes  
* Shape Detector - Intermediate Level

## **Requirements** #
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.6.0 or higher.
* [opencv](https://opencv.org/releases/) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) modules installed
* Any IDE like:- ([Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) or [Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

## **Codes** ##
1. [Triangle Can or Can't](1.py)
2. [The Tasks List Creator](2.py)
3. [The Image Displayer](3.py)
4. [The Work Place Teller](4.py)
5. [Rectangle or Square](5.py)
6. [Sum & Average Calculator](6.py)
7. [Image Blur](7.py)
8. [Image Resizer](8.py)
9. [Triangle Type](9.py)
10. [Shape Detector](ShapeDetector.py)

## **Explanation** ##
* ###  [1st Code](1.py)
![1st code img](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81790487/114462454-ae1cfb00-9c00-11eb-8b94-d71aad393f5f.PNG)
**Inputs** - The code requires 3 sides of triangle as input. <br />
**Working** - The Code first stores the value of the 3 inputs in from of variables & then it compares every side using logic that the sum of two sides is never Greater than 3rd Side.<br /> 
**Results** - The results tells us if these Dimensions could form a Triangle.
***
* ### [2nd Code](2.py)

Explaination The code inputs the lenght of the dictionary you want to create Then It Inputs any string or Integer According to mentioned lenght and creates one dictionary for you
***
* ### [3rd Code](3.py)
**Inputs** - The code requires an path of an [Image]() as input to be added in the code. <br />
**Working** - The Code displays Images using functions of cv2 library. <br /> 
**Results** - The results displays us Image whose path we added in the code.<br />
__The Image Below Shows the result to the code__<br />

***
* ### [4th Code](4.py)

Explanantion The code inputs Age & gender(M Or F) It then tells you if you can work in Urban areas,anywhere and shows error if you can't work Anywhere
***
* ### [5th Code](5.py)

Explanation The code inputs lenght & width of a rectangle or square. It then tells if it's a rectangle or square along with its area & Perimeter.
***
* ### [6th Code](6.py)

Explaination The code first inputs the Length of the list you want to create

It then calculates the average & Sum of the Integers in the list For eg:- It inputs list like:-1,2,3,5(Input with Commas but without Spaces) Then After pressing "Enter" It Tells us the sum & Average of the List
***
* ### [7th Code](7.py)

Explaination The code Inputs an Image and converts it to a Blurred Image of which you can play with the Blur you need This Program needs opencv-python or cv2 module to be installed You can increase the value of x for increase in Blur effect (But value of x should be odd ) You must also enter the path of Img you want within double Inverted Commas.
***
* ### [8th Code](8.py)

Explanation The code inputs path of any Image and resize it to desired size for you You can can change values of x and y to change Resize Image accordingly eg :- If you want an image to be converted to the size of 240 * 360 ,then you just simply put x = 240 & y = 360 when it asks for input.
***
* ### [9th Code](9.py)

Explaination The code inputs the lenght of the sides of triangle without SI unit & tells the type of Triangle it is.

## **[The code of ShapeDetector.py](ShapeDetector.py)** ##

Explaination The Code Inputs the Path of an Image which Contain various 2D - shapes & detect many shapes and also label them It Requires Cv2 & Numpy Library to be Installed.

I have also added a Picture to Repository named "Shapes.png". Just download it and add its path in ShapeDetector.py at line no. 37.
