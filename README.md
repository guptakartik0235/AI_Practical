## Introduction ## 
Hey there!
I am Kartik Gupta & this is my  a Repository with 
* 9 python Basic codes  
* Shape Detector - Intermediate Level
## **Codes** ##
1. [Triangle Can or Can't](1.py)
2. [The Tasks List Creator](2.py)
3. [The Image Displayer](3.py)
4. [The Work Place Teller](4.py)
5. [Rectangle or Square](5.py)
6. [Sum & Average Calculator](6.py)
7. [Image Blur](7.py)
8. [Image Resizer](8.py)
9. [Triangle Type](9.py)
10.[Shape Detector]

* The code of [1.py](1.py)

Explaination This code inputs 3 sides of a triangle and tells that if they are right to form a Triangle or not.

* The code of 2.py

Explaination The code inputs the lenght of the dictionary you want to create Then It Inputs any string or Integer According to mentioned lenght and creates one dictionary for you

* The code of 3.py

Explaination The code inputs path of an image and displays the image at Particular Path It requires opencv-python library to be installed within the computer

* The code of 4.py

Explanantion The code inputs Age & gender(M Or F) It then tells you if you can work in Urban areas,anywhere and shows error if you can't work Anywhere

* The code of 5.py

Explanation The code inputs lenght & width of a rectangle or square. It then tells if it's a rectangle or square along with its area & Perimeter.

* The code of 6.py

Explaination The code first inputs the Length of the list you want to create

It then calculates the average & Sum of the Integers in the list For eg:- It inputs list like:-1,2,3,5(Input with Commas but without Spaces) Then After pressing "Enter" It Tells us the sum & Average of the List

* The code of 7.py

Explaination The code Inputs an Image and converts it to a Blurred Image of which you can play with the Blur you need This Program needs opencv-python or cv2 module to be installed You can increase the value of x for increase in Blur effect (But value of x should be odd ) You must also enter the path of Img you want within double Inverted Commas.

* The code of 8.py

Explanation The code inputs path of any Image and resize it to desired size for you You can can change values of x and y to change Resize Image accordingly eg :- If you want an image to be converted to the size of 240 * 360 ,then you just simply put x = 240 & y = 360 when it asks for input.

* The code of 9.py

Explaination The code inputs the lenght of the sides of triangle without SI unit & tells the type of Triangle it is.

## ***The code of ShapeDetector.py*** ##

Explaination The Code Inputs the Path of an Image which Contain various 2D - shapes & detect many shapes and also label them It Requires Cv2 & Numpy Library to be Installed.

I have also added a Picture to Repository named "Shapes.png". Just download it and add its path in ShapeDetector.py at line no. 37.
